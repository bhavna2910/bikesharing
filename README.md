### Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike data

## Overview
Have created two Tableau deliverables for:
1. Module 14- 
2. Challenge for Module 14- 

The guideline for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions that would help them to make a decision.
For this, Tableau was used to present detailed worksheets and dashboards and story was created from those worksheets to emphasize on decision parameters.
