# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike data

## Overview
Have created two Tableau deliverables for:
1. Module 14- 
2. Challenge for Module 14- 

The guideline for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions that would help them to make a decision.
For this, Tableau was used to present detailed worksheets and dashboards and story was created from those worksheets to emphasize on decision parameters.

## Approach
### Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Per the ask, using Python and Pandas function, changed the data type of "tripduration" column in csv file from an integer to a datetime in Jupyer notebook to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00) and leveraged it for creating worksheets in Tableau.

### Deliverable 2: Created 5 Worksheets highlighting below Visualizations
1. Checkout Times for Users
2. Checkout Times by Gender
3. Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) 
5. User Trips by Gender by Weekday 

### Deliverable 3: Created a Story and Report
Story 1: Created using 5 Worksheets- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bhavna.aggarwal/viz/NYC_CitiBike_Analysis_Challenge14/BikesharingAnalysis-Story1?publish=yes
